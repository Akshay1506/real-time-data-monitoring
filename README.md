# Real-Time Data Monitoring 🚀

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is designed to monitor real-time data streams, process the incoming data, and visualize key metrics dynamically. The goal is to enable real-time decision-making by observing live data patterns.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Live visualization of streaming data
- Scalable and modular architecture
- Error handling for uninterrupted monitoring
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills Used

- Python Programming
- WebSocket Communication
- Data Visualization (`matplotlib`, `plotly`)
- Multithreading & Asynchronous Programming
- API Integration (if any)
- Data Parsing (JSON/CSV)
- Error Handling & Logging
- Version Control (Git & GitHub)
